## Data Attainment

### Data is not my own

Data comes from a [Census Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a43hch/survey_results_subreddit_update/) in the ClassWow subreddit performed in December 2018

The data was downloaded in the form of .csv from [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lXQJd9z7vLCZN1-MKl5Y8j3AQxuW0SiZnNKeGXgBuF0/edit#gid=0), converted to .json, and [Served From Here](https://github.com/aablain/classic-survey-results)
